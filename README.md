# Port-Scanner

Port Scanner is built in C# using Avalonia UI for its interface. It pings hosts, performs reverse DNS lookups, scans custom port ranges (e.g., 1-100, 500-800, etc...), detects open/closed ports, detects the service and tries to grab the banner and exports results to Excel, which makes it a flexible and user-friendly network scanning tool.

## How It Works



## Coming Soon

- Ability to set the scanning speed to reduce timeouts and minimize detection by the target service.  
- Support for advanced scanning techniques.
- Improved export options, such as JSON, etc...
- Customizable scan profiles to save and reuse scan settings, such as saving the host, port ranges, speed, etc...
